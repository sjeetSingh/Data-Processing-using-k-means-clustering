## Data Processing using kmeans Clustering

For this project, I have used R to implement k-means clustering. The web interface is build in R using Shiny. [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/)

###**ui.R**
ui.R is a User-Interface script which controls the layout and apperance of the app. 

###**server.R**
server.R is a server script which stores the main logic of the app. 

###**titanic.csv**
A CSV file, is the input file conataining the data to be processed.

####**Running this app**
The app can be executed by writing the command: `runApp("my_app")` on the R console where,

`my_app` is the directory where the files- ui.R and server.R are stored.

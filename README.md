# kmeansClustering

In this illustration, k-means Clustering is implemented in R language. I've build the interface in R using Shiny. [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/) is an R package used to build web applications. 

 

###**ui.R**
ui.R is a User-Interface script which controls the layout and apperance of the app. 

###**server.R**
server.R is a server script which stores the main logic of the app. 

###**titanic.csv**
This is the main input, data file.

####**Running this app**
The app can be executed by writing the command: `runApp("my_app")` on the R console where,

`my_app` is the directory where the files- ui.R and server.R are stored.
